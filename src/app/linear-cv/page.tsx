        <h1 className="text-2xl">Why I want to join Linear</h1>

        <p>
          A big fan of Linear here. As a very product/UX minded engineer, I
          couldn&apos;t stand most software I &quot;had to use&quot; for work.
          It seemed like everything must be some combination of slow, bloated
          and hard to use or too simple and not supporting proper workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Linear felt like the first software that &quot;gets it&quot;. It set
          the standard for work software that doesn&apos;t make compromises.
          <br />
          Over the years I&apos;ve used Linear on multiple projects, big and
          small. Always loved it. Never felt frustrated or needing more.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I kept thinking, how great would be to work on a product like
          this.
          <br />
          At the same time, the bar for the quality of the people working there
          seemed too high and I felt like an imposter if I would&apos;ve applied
          for a job.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year, after being able to make an impact in Miro after building
          the foundations of video calls on the board, I decided to shoot for
          the stars and apply to Linear next year. And as luck would have it, I
          got an email from Amelia and here we are.
        </p>

        <h4>Side note about product work</h4>

        <p>
          I didn&apos;t know how much product work is part of the
          engineer&apos;s role in Linear.
          <br />
          But I love it!
        </p>

        <p>
          It&apos;s always been my goal to not just build good software, but
          build great products with nice UI and UX, that users love.
          <br />
          At Productboard I was learning from great PMs and helped shape parts
          of the product. I worked on product and design iterations at Around.
          Learned about product analytics or doing customer interviews.
          <br />
          Even though about switching to a PM role but would miss the actual
          building.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I&apos;m trying to say is that even though I don&apos;t have too
          much direct product management experience, I&apos;ve picked up the
          basics and I&apos;m eager to learn and grow.
        </p>
