If you want to save time and frustration next time building a new app or a feature, read on…\nHere are some tips from my experience with building web apps in React.\n\nQuick ground rules:\n\n- Always prototype. Even the small, sure things.\n- Simplify everything. The dummer the code looks the better.\n- Don’t split code. Aim for easiest editing.\n- Use UI kits and generative tools.\n- Don’t use any prototype code in the production version.\n\n## Prototyping is too important to skip\n\nDoesn’t matter if you work in a big team or alone, prototyping allows getting to the best product UX and UI faster because it shortens the feedback loop by a mile and makes iterating so much easier.\n\nYou’ll always iterate on features. It’s rarely a banger on the first try. There will be use case not thought through. UI not understood. There will be new ideas. You get the point. Go through this on easy mode and only revise the prototype.\n\nBesides that, you should always get feedback from customers and teammates before the development begins. It’s too late after it’s all built. And there’s no better way to get real feedback than using a real feeling thing – the prototype.\nAfter getting feedback you can update it in a matter of minutes and test again. You’ll have a product users love in no time.\n\nNow for the practical bits…\n\n## Prototype a new app\n\nThis is the easiest to do (and a joy). There are no technical blocks to get through, and you can literally build whatever you can imagine. Speed is your friend here.\n\nTry to squeeze everything in one file. Thinking how to split the code and then finding the right parts to update is wasted time right now.\nStore data in the simplest structures. No optimizations or clean code needed or wanted.\nAnd use a ready-made UI kit. Custom styling takes the most time and is pointless. You can customize the kit’s theme if needed.\n\nYou should be able to get a decent sized interactive app prototype made like this in couple hours tops.\n\n## Adding a new feature can be simple too\n\nYou just need to forget most code exists.\n\nBuild the new feature in isolation - one file / component / place. Point is not having to hunt for stuff to change in multiple places. If you need to add new UI in multiple places, it’s better to import it there from your new feature file.\n\nUse dummy data for the new feature. It’s much easier to manage the prototype experience when there’s easy control over the data it uses. Copy what API returns now, paste statically to code, add new data as needed.\n\nAs an extension of that, minimize dependencies on other app’s logic. Copy what you need or add proxies that extend business logic.\n\n## Improve features quick and dirty style\n\nI would prototype even feature improvements. You never know if a sneaky UX glitch hasn’t weaseled its way in.\n\nThere are no recommendations how to do this exactly. Other than make it as quick and dirty as possible.\n\n## Final step – throw it all away\n\nEven if PMs tell you “it’s great, ship it”, it’s not great. If you’ve been following my advice you have no pieces that should hit the customers.\n\nWait with the git reset tho. I mean, don’t use the code itself but use it as a guide. Go to the right places and implement the ideas from the prototype the right way.\n\n“I haven’t followed your advice and got the perfect code on the first try”. Chances are it could be better. Try doing the same – rewrite the code from scratch, and you’ll make it better on the second try.\n\n## Tools for happy prototyping\n\n### React UI Kits\n\n- for modern, fun look go with [Chakra UI]\n- or common UI everybody’s used to – Material[ UI]\n- other branded design systems on the corporate style side:\n  - Adobe’s [Spectrum]\n  - MS Fluent UI [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/]\n  - Ant design [https://ant.design/]\n  - Uber’s Baseweb [https://baseweb.design/.]\n\nIn most cases – new products, startups, I recommend Chakra. It looks great and is easy to use.\n\n### Fake data\n\nGenerate fake data with Fakerjs. Use real-looking names, addresses, etc. to make the prototype more realistic.\n\n### Component sandbox\n\nIf you need more complex or interaction-heavy components, best develop them in isolation in tools like StoryBook or Ladle\n\n### Theme designer\n\nTo give the prototype a more branded feel – to make it more real – edit the theme easily with Duotone\n\n_More maker/UX content coming soon. Until next time…_\n",
