Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\n\nIn that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.\n",
